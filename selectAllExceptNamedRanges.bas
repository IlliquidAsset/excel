' This macro selects a specific range (A1:P255) on the active sheet, excluding any cells
' that fall within two named ranges: "protectedRow" and "protectedCol".
'
' SETUP & PREREQS:
' 1. Enable macros in Excel.
' 2. Define named ranges "protectedRow" and "protectedCol" before running this.
' 3. Adjust the A1:P255 range as needed for your workbook.
